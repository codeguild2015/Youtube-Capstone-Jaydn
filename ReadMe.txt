This is my Capstone project for PDX CodeGuild Fall 2015 class. Being new to the field and industry I made a portfolio site for myself to host my future projects. The main feature for this project was populating my videos page with all the videos on my YouTube channel "Jaydn Clausen", as well as allowing users to create accounts and log into them which will have a more practical use down the line, such as restricting access to the games page unless the user is logged into a valid account. This is and will continue to be an ongoing project as I continue to work towards my degree in Computer Science.
